This is a Snake game written in C called Cnake. It was made with SDL.
Controls: When in game, press Q to quit, B to go back to the menu, N for new game

The A.I. works as follows:
Try to minimize the X value first, then the Y value. If this fails, do it the other way. If this fails, find a random path and try the process again.
This A.I. is not the best Snake A.I., that would be to find a Hamiltonian path and traverse it until the game ends. But how boring is that?

Modify constants.h and Cmake depending on your system to compile
